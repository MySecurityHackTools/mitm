# This was created out of a curiosity for the intercepting and modifying live traffic I have
# read so much about. When searching for a good tool to allow modification of
# data streams I fell short... so here we go.
#
# !!! NOT FOR MALLICIOUS USE !!!
#
# This is my first ever python program, so please forgive the usual amateur mistakes
# any improvements/critisism (constructive only please) then let me know.
#
# Usage is pretty simple and an example has been provided at the bottom of the
# python code.

# Used in the following topology:
#
# [Host] <--> [Router]
#
# We run this program and the layer 2 layout changes to:
#
# [Host] <--> [Us] <--> [Router]
#
# It works as follows:
# we send 2 continuous arp replies
# one to the Host
# one to the router
#
# each arp contains our MAC address
#
# Data is captured by this program by sniffing raw data
# We can intervene in the stream of data by dropping packets, changing packets etc..
#
# The framework allows a callback for specific protocols to a subroutine
